# TryHackMe: Juicy Details - Log Analysis Challenge

## Challenge Overview

**Platform:** TryHackMe  
**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Category:** Digital Forensics, Log Analysis, Incident Response  
**Completed:** 2024

**Challenge Description:**  
Investigate a security breach of a popular juice shop e-commerce platform by analyzing system and application logs. This challenge simulates a real-world incident response scenario where a SOC analyst must determine the attack vector, tools used, timeline of events, and scope of compromise through log analysis alone.

## Objectives

- Analyze system logs to identify indicators of compromise
- Determine initial attack vector and entry point
- Identify tools and techniques used by the attacker
- Reconstruct timeline of attacker activities
- Assess scope and impact of the breach
- Document findings in incident report format

## Skills Demonstrated

- System log analysis and interpretation
- Attack pattern recognition
- Timeline reconstruction from log data
- Indicator of Compromise (IOC) identification
- Incident investigation methodology
- Root cause analysis
- Security event correlation
- Incident documentation and reporting

## Tools Used

- **Log Analysis:** System logs, application logs, web server logs
- **Text Processing:** grep, awk, less (Linux command-line tools)
- **Timeline Analysis:** Manual correlation and chronological reconstruction
- **Pattern Recognition:** Identifying suspicious patterns in log entries

## Investigation Methodology

### Phase 1: Initial Triage

**Objective:** Understand what logs are available and establish baseline.

**Approach:**
- Reviewed all available log sources
- Identified log formats and timestamps
- Established timeline boundaries (when did logging start/end)
- Noted any gaps in logging that might indicate tampering

**Key Questions:**
- What happened?
- When did it happen?
- How did the attacker gain access?
- What tools did they use?
- What was compromised?

### Phase 2: Attack Vector Identification

**Objective:** Determine how the attacker initially gained access to the system.

**Log Analysis Findings:**

**Initial Compromise Indicators:**
- Unusual authentication patterns in access logs
- Failed login attempts followed by successful authentication
- Access from unexpected IP addresses or geographic locations
- Login attempts outside normal business hours

**Attack Vector Discovered:**
- Analyzed web application logs for exploitation attempts
- Identified SQL injection patterns in request parameters
- Found evidence of authentication bypass techniques
- Discovered initial foothold through web application vulnerability

**Key Learning:**
Understanding web application attack patterns is critical. Common injection indicators include:
- Unusual characters in URL parameters (quotes, semicolons, SQL keywords)
- Multiple requests with slight variations (automated testing)
- Error messages revealing database structure
- Successful requests following many failures

### Phase 3: Tool and Technique Identification

**Objective:** Identify what tools the attacker used and their methodology.

**Evidence from Logs:**

**Reconnaissance Activity:**
- Patterns indicating directory enumeration/fuzzing
- User-agent strings associated with scanning tools
- Sequential requests suggesting automated scanning
- Requests for common administrative paths

**Exploitation Tools Detected:**
- SQLMap or similar injection frameworks (based on request patterns)
- Web shells or backdoors (identified through suspicious file access)
- Credential dumping tools (based on unusual database queries)
- Enumeration scripts (systematic information gathering patterns)

**Techniques Observed:**
- SQL injection for authentication bypass
- Command injection attempts in input fields
- File upload exploitation
- Privilege escalation attempts in system logs

**Key Learning:**
Attackers leave fingerprints in logs through:
- Consistent user-agent strings
- Timing patterns of automated tools
- Specific parameter encoding methods
- Characteristic request sequences

### Phase 4: Timeline Reconstruction

**Objective:** Build chronological sequence of attacker activities.

**Attack Timeline Developed:**

1. **Initial Reconnaissance** (Timestamp range)
   - Port scanning (if network logs available)
   - Web directory enumeration
   - Application fingerprinting

2. **Vulnerability Discovery** (Timestamp range)
   - SQL injection testing in login form
   - Multiple injection payloads attempted
   - Successful bypass of authentication

3. **Initial Access** (Timestamp range)
   - First successful authentication bypass
   - Enumeration of application functionality
   - Identification of administrative functions

4. **Privilege Escalation** (Timestamp range)
   - Attempts to access administrative features
   - Database query manipulation
   - User account enumeration

5. **Data Exfiltration** (Timestamp range)
   - Large database queries
   - Unusual data access patterns
   - Multiple requests for sensitive endpoints

6. **Persistence Establishment** (If applicable)
   - Creation of backdoor accounts
   - Web shell upload
   - Configuration modifications

**Key Learning:**
Timeline analysis reveals:
- Dwell time (how long attacker had access)
- Sophistication level (automated vs manual)
- Objectives (quick smash-and-grab vs careful, persistent access)
- Potential for data exfiltration

### Phase 5: Impact Assessment

**Objective:** Determine what was compromised and scope of damage.

**Compromised Systems/Data:**
- User credentials accessed (quantity and sensitivity)
- Payment information exposure (if applicable)
- Personal identifiable information (PII) accessed
- Administrative access achieved (yes/no)
- Database contents exposed

**Indicators of Data Exfiltration:**
- Large volume of database queries
- Download of customer records
- Access to sensitive tables
- Unusual outbound network connections (if available)
