**Objective:**  
Conduct comprehensive penetration test with minimal prior knowledge to identify vulnerabilities, exploit systems, and document findings in professional client-deliverable format.

### Executive Summary

Successfully identified and exploited multiple critical vulnerabilities leading to complete system compromise:

**Attack Chain:**
1. Network reconnaissance revealing exposed SMB share and web server
2. Unauthenticated SMB access (null session vulnerability)
3. Credential exposure through unsecured password file
4. Web server exploitation via reverse shell deployment
5. Privilege escalation using SeImpersonatePrivilege
6. Full administrative access achieved (SYSTEM level)

**Critical Findings:**
- **Null session enabled** on SMB share (no authentication required)
- **Credentials stored in plaintext** on publicly accessible share
- **SeImpersonatePrivilege enabled** on Windows IIS Server
- **No network segmentation** between services

**Impact:** Complete system compromise with administrative control

### Technical Methodology

#### Phase 1: Reconnaissance & Enumeration

**Port Scanning:**
- Tool: Threader3000 + Nmap
- Discovered 8 open ports: 135, 80, 139, 445, 3389, 49663, 49666, 49668
- Identified Windows system with SMB and IIS web server
- Enumerated NetBIOS information and computer name

**Service Enumeration:**
- SMB share "nt4wrksv" discovered without authentication
- Web server confirmed on port 49663
- Directory enumeration using GoBuster revealed accessible paths

**Key Finding:** SMB share accessible without credentials (null session attack)

#### Phase 2: Vulnerability Analysis

**Critical Vulnerabilities Identified:**

1. **Null Session on SMB (CVE-level severity)**
   - No authentication required to access SMB share
   - Read and write permissions available to anonymous users
   - Allows arbitrary file upload/download

2. **Credential Exposure**
   - passwords.txt file stored in publicly accessible SMB share
   - Base64-encoded credentials (weak obfuscation)
   - Multiple user accounts exposed

3. **SeImpersonatePrivilege Enabled**
   - Windows privilege escalation vector
   - Exploitable via PrintSpoofer and similar tools
   - Leads directly to SYSTEM-level access

4. **Lack of Network Segmentation**
   - Web server and file share on same network segment
   - No isolation between services
   - Single point of failure

#### Phase 3: Exploitation

**Step 1: Initial Access**
- Tool: smbclient
- Method: Null session authentication
- Result: Read/write access to nt4wrksv share
- Evidence: Successfully retrieved passwords.txt

**Step 2: Credential Recovery**
- Method: Base64 decoding of password hashes
- Users discovered: Bob, Administrator
- Passwords: Plaintext recovery successful

**Step 3: Web Shell Deployment**
- Tool: msfvenom
- Payload: windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp
- Format: .aspx (IIS web server compatible)
- Delivery: Uploaded via SMB share, accessed via web server
- Result: Reverse shell established

**Step 4: Privilege Escalation**
- Tool: PrintSpoofer.exe
- Vulnerability: SeImpersonatePrivilege enabled
- Method: Token impersonation exploit
- Result: Elevated to NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM

**Step 5: Post-Exploitation**
- Access achieved: Full system administrative control
- Flags captured: User flag (Bob's directory) + Administrator flag
- Persistence: Multiple backdoors available for continued access

### Tools & Techniques Used

**Reconnaissance:**
- Threader3000 - Port discovery
- Nmap - Service enumeration and OS fingerprinting
- GoBuster - Directory/file enumeration
- smbclient - SMB share enumeration

**Exploitation:**
- msfvenom - Reverse shell payload generation
- Netcat - Reverse shell listener
- PrintSpoofer - Privilege escalation
- Base64 decoding - Credential recovery

**Frameworks:**

- Kill Chain methodology
- MITRE ATT&CK mapping

### Forensics & Detection Perspective

**As a forensic investigator, this engagement taught:**

**Attack Indicators (IOCs):**
- Unusual SMB connections without authentication
- Anonymous SMB access patterns
- New .aspx file creation in web directories
- Reverse shell network connections (unusual outbound traffic)
- Privilege escalation attempts in Windows Event Logs
- Execution of PrintSpoofer.exe or similar tools

**Evidence Locations:**
- SMB server logs (connection attempts, file transfers)
- IIS web server logs (suspicious .aspx requests)
- Windows Security Event Logs (Event ID 4672 - privilege escalation)
- Network traffic (reverse shell connections)
- File system artifacts (uploaded malicious files)
- Process creation logs (Sysmon Event ID 1)

**Timeline Reconstruction:**

For incident response, this attack would appear as:
1. Multiple SMB connection attempts
2. File download from SMB share (passwords.txt)
3. File upload to SMB share (rev.aspx)
4. HTTP request to newly created .aspx file
5. Outbound network connection established
6. Privilege escalation event (SeImpersonatePrivilege used)
7. Access to sensitive directories

### Professional Deliverable

**Report Components Created:**
- Executive Summary for non-technical stakeholders
- Technical findings with evidence screenshots
- Attack narrative documenting methodology
- Risk assessment and severity ratings

- Clear communication of technical concepts
- Actionable remediation steps
- Business impact analysis
- Compliance considerations

### Key Recommendations Provided

**Immediate Actions (Critical):**
1. Disable null session on SMB share - require authentication
2. Remove password files from file shares
3. Disable SeImpersonatePrivilege unless required
4. Audit and remove uploaded malicious files

**Short-term Remediations:**
1. Implement network segmentation (separate web server and file share)
2. Use dedicated ports for different services
3. Enable SMB signing to prevent MITM attacks
4. Implement least privilege access controls

**Long-term Security Improvements:**
1. Regular vulnerability assessments
2. Penetration testing on recurring schedule
3. Security awareness training
4. Implement IDS/IPS for anomaly detection
5. Enhanced logging and SIEM deployment

- SMB protocol exploitation
- Web server attack vectors
- Reverse shell deployment and handling
- Windows privilege escalation
- Post-exploitation techniques

**Professional Skills:**
- Collaborative penetration testing

- IOC identification from attacker perspective
- Log analysis for detection opportunities

### Real-World Application

**This project simulates actual penetration testing engagements conducted by:**
- External security consultants
- Red teams in large organizations
- Compliance-required security assessments
- Third-party risk assessments

**For digital forensics, understanding offensive techniques helps with:**
- Incident investigation (knowing what to look for)
- Evidence collection (understanding artifact locations)
- Attack attribution (recognizing tools and techniques)
- Detection rule development (identifying indicators)

### Why This Matters for Forensics Career

Forensic investigators need to understand offensive security because:

1. **Know Your Adversary:** Can't investigate what you don't understand
2. **Evidence Recognition:** Knowing attack tools helps identify their artifacts
3. **Timeline Accuracy:** Understanding attack sequences improves reconstruction
4. **Detection Development:** Offensive knowledge informs defensive strategies
5. **Expert Testimony:** May need to explain attack methods in legal proceedings

**Purple Team Perspective:**  
This project bridges red team (offensive) and blue team (defensive) skills - both essential for comprehensive forensic investigation and incident response.
