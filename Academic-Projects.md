- Network traffic (reverse shell connections)
- File system artifacts (uploaded malicious files)
- Process creation logs (Sysmon Event ID 1)

**Timeline Reconstruction:**

For incident response, this attack would appear as:
1. Multiple SMB connection attempts
2. File download from SMB share (passwords.txt)
3. File upload to SMB share (rev.aspx)
4. HTTP request to newly created .aspx file
5. Outbound network connection established
6. Privilege escalation event (SeImpersonatePrivilege used)
7. Access to sensitive directories

### Professional Deliverable

- **Severity:** Low
- **Risk:** Cryptographic weakness allows potential hash collision attacks
- **Impact:** Message integrity compromise, potential authentication bypass
- **Attack Vector:** Cryptographic attacks against weak MAC algorithms (MD5-based)

### Technical Remediation

#### Remediation 1: NFS Share Access Control (Critical)

**Problem Identified:**
- NFS shares accessible without authentication
- Anonymous mounting possible from any network location
- Read/write access available to unauthorized users

**Solution Implemented:**

**Step 1: Mount Configuration**
- Mounted Metasploitable2 /home directory to /tmp/safemnt
- Validated proper mount points and permissions

**Step 2: Access Control Lists**
- Modified `/etc/hosts.deny`: Added `portmap: ALL` to block all external access
- Modified `/etc/hosts.allow`: Added `portmap: 192.168.35.0/255.255.255.0` to whitelist trusted subnet only
- Implemented network-based access control (principle of least privilege)

**Security Impact:**
- Eliminated anonymous NFS access
- Restricted access to trusted network segment only
- Prevented unauthorized file system mounting

**Validation:**
- Re-scanned with Nessus
- Critical vulnerability no longer detected
- Access controls verified functional

#### Remediation 2: Telnet Service Mitigation (Medium)

**Problem Identified:**
- Telnet server listening on port 23
- Cleartext protocol transmits credentials unencrypted
- Modern SSH alternative not enforced

**Solution Implemented:**

**Firewall Configuration:**
```
sudo ufw enable              # Enable firewall (was disabled)
```
```
sudo ufw deny 23             # Block Telnet port
```
```
sudo ufw status              # Verify rule active
```

**Approach Rationale:**
