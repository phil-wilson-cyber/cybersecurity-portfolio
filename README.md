**Forensics Skills:** Attack pattern recognition, hash analysis, privilege escalation indicators, evidence collection

### 5. [Academic Digital Forensics Projects](./academic-projects.md)
Professional security projects including **[full-scope penetration test (view report PDF)](./EthicalHackingGroupProject_Finished.pdf)**, digital forensics investigation (Rhino NIST Hunt), incident response procedures, and MITRE ATT&CK framework application.

**Forensics Skills:** Digital evidence handling, forensic investigation methodology, incident response, professional report writing

## Professional Experience

**IT Field Specialist** | Current Role

Network and infrastructure specialist with security awareness and investigative mindset:

**Daily Responsibilities:**
- Network and infrastructure discovery for deployment and optimization projects
- Network troubleshooting and root cause analysis for connectivity issues
- Configuration management and documentation for network devices (FortiGate, Ubiquiti)
- System monitoring and performance analysis
- Day-to-day operations maintaining network infrastructure

**Security-Relevant Activities:**
- Identify and escalate potential security issues to security team
- Analyze network traffic and logs during troubleshooting (foundational forensics skills)
- Document system configurations and changes with technical precision
- Investigate root causes of infrastructure incidents (investigative methodology)
- Understand baseline network behavior, making anomalies recognizable

**Forensics-Applicable Skills Developed:**
- **Investigative Mindset:** Daily troubleshooting requires same systematic approach as forensic investigation
- **Network Understanding:** Deep knowledge of how networks operate normally - critical for identifying malicious activity
- **Log Analysis:** Regular work with system and network logs for troubleshooting
- **Documentation:** Precise technical documentation habits required for forensic evidence handling
- **Pattern Recognition:** Identifying abnormal behavior in network traffic and system logs
- **Root Cause Analysis:** Determining "what happened and why" - core forensics skill

**Why This Matters for Forensics:**
IT troubleshooting methodology directly translates to forensic investigation. Both require:
- Systematic evidence collection
- Timeline reconstruction from logs
- Understanding normal vs abnormal behavior
- Precise documentation
- Analytical thinking to determine root cause

## Current Focus

Actively building digital forensics and incident response capabilities:

**Network Forensics:**
- PCAP analysis and protocol examination
- Network traffic pattern analysis
- Attack reconstruction from network evidence
- Malicious activity identification in network logs

**System Forensics:**
- Windows and Linux log analysis
- Timeline reconstruction from multiple log sources
- Process and file system analysis
- Memory forensics fundamentals (learning)

**Incident Response:**
- Rapid incident triage and scoping
- Evidence collection and preservation
- IOC extraction and threat intelligence
- Forensic reporting and documentation

**Continuous Learning:**
- TryHackMe digital forensics and incident response paths
- SANS reading room and forensic case studies
- Practicing with publicly available forensic datasets
- Building home lab for forensic tool practice

## Areas of Interest

- **Network Forensics** - Traffic analysis, protocol forensics, attack reconstruction
- **Incident Response** - Breach investigation, threat hunting, evidence collection
- **Malware Analysis** - Behavioral analysis, IOC extraction (developing skills)
- **Memory Forensics** - RAM analysis, volatile evidence collection (learning)
- **Timeline Analysis** - Event correlation, attack chain reconstruction

## Why Digital Forensics?

My IT infrastructure background provides unique advantages for forensic investigation:

- **Deep System Understanding:** Know how systems should operate normally, making anomalies obvious
- **Network Expertise:** Can analyze network traffic at protocol level, not just surface indicators  
- **Troubleshooting Mindset:** Investigation methodology from IT translates directly to forensics
- **Documentation Skills:** Accustomed to precise technical documentation required in forensics
